Creating a fully functional Chess game with detailed specifications for each rule and requirement is an extensive task. Here, is an overview of how you can approach implementing some of the core rules and requirements of Chess using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles


1. Chess Game Rules:
   - Piece Movements: Implement the movement rules for each Chess piece.

   - Check and Checkmate: Implement rules to detect when a King is in check and when a checkmate occurs.

   - Castling: Allow for castling when the King and a Rook meet the necessary conditions.

    - Pawn Promotion: Handle pawn promotion when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank.



2. Object-Oriented Design:

   - Classes: Create classes for Chessboard, Chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn), players, and game logic.

   - Inheritance: Utilize inheritance to model piece behaviors. For example, create a base `Piece` class with common properties and extend it for each piece type.

   - Polymorphism: Implement polymorphism to handle different piece movements. Each piece class should override a common `move` method with piece-specific logic.



3. Player Interaction:

   - Turn-Based Play: Allow two players to take turns.

   - Console Display: Display the Chessboard in the console. You can represent the board as an 8x8 grid using characters for pieces.

   - Input Handling: Prompt players for moves, and validate input for correctness.


4. Validation:

   - Move Validation: Implement logic to validate whether a move adheres to the rules. For instance, check if a move is within the piece's allowed range, and if it doesn't expose the King to check.

   - Illegal Moves: Handle illegal moves gracefully, providing feedback to players.


5. Game State:

   - Check and Checkmate: Detect when a King is in check. If a King is checkmated, end the game.

   - Stalemate and Draw: Implement rules for stalemate (when a player has no legal moves) and draw conditions (e.g., insufficient material).

   - Declare Winner: Declare the winner when the game ends due to checkmate or draw.


6. User Interface (Optional):

   - Console UI: Create a user-friendly console interface that visually represents the Chessboard, displays player names, and accepts player input.


7. Testing:

   - Test Cases: Develop a suite of test cases to verify the correctness of your Chess game. Test various scenarios to ensure that the game functions as expected.


8. Documentation:

   - Rules Explanation: Provide detailed documentation explaining the rules of Chess, how to play the game, and any special features or mechanics in your implementation.

   - Code Comments: Include comments in your code to describe classes and methods.


9. Advanced Features (Optional):

   - Player Rankings: Implement a system to rank players based on their performance.

   - Undo/Redo Moves: Allow players to undo and redo moves.
